# Bikera
Turn bikes into IoT devices

What is Bikera? 
Bikera is a blockchain ecosystem that will function as a means to lend transportation and have it seamlessly maintained,
without having to worry about having a flat tire or any other mechanical difficulty that might cause inability to travel to your destination.

The Bikera network will always keep all the necessary parties informed on the latest and these will then swiftly present solutions. 
The means of transportation isn’t a solo challenge but a group effort. Depending on the class/group, roles will be assigned to accounts/persons. 
Acting on this role and delivering the requested solutions will result in a merit for these accounts/persons.

Accounts:
users would be comprised of classes/groups, each having a purpose to adding value to the ecosystem. Anyone can be in any or all of these groups. 

Consensus:
The ecosystem safeguarding will be done by the numbers of the masses and the randomness of travel-trajectory of these individuals,
this contributes to the Proof of Transit consensus protocol that will be used to mine the blocks.  
A layer2 solution will be used to track the bikes in movement; using LoraWAn nodes to verify the movement is real, 
this will route information to our own side blockchain, which will be used to fulfill contracts and token releases 
all our tokens will be created on this layer 2 or 1 blockchain for security reasons and immutability.  

Physical Assets:
Having real world assets used in a decentralized virtual system, needs a bridge between the virtual and the real world. 
This will be done by the development of a multi-functional lock. This lock will be implemented with a long-distance radio for receiving and transmitting data. 
There will also need to be storage to securely store private and public keys or other data. 
A GPS-module and/or Cellular network connectivity can be used to verify the location of the transportation, 
as feedback to the node network of gateway devices linking the lock to the blockchain. 

Wireless Communication: 
A network of radio receiving nodes need to be used or placed to receive data of these locks. 
Multiple nodes throughout a “two” dimensional space can be used to triangulate these locks and verify its location. 
The use-case of legacy or centralized networks can be used in the beginning and as verification of the decentralized network.
